## Box Spacing Basics

### What is CSS Box Model?

- ![](<z-Assets/CSS%20Box%20Model%20(盒模型)-Parts%20of%20Box%20Model.png>)
- The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box

### Margin

- Margin collapsing
  - happens if you are creating space with margins and don't get the space you expect

### Padding

### [Borders](Borders.md)

- top, right, bottom, left
- width, style, color
